The ability to uncover new patterns and evolve the questions that historians are able to ask are greatly enhanced through the use of tools that allow changes to scale
Being able to take a data set and view at a distance can show patterns that could go undetected if one only does close readings based on keywords
These tools become especially useful when skilled historians can use their prior knowledge to select tighter perameters in dates/keywords
This intersectionality can further be illumited by now delving into close reading of specific parts of the data set that you identified
As you analyse the patterns and verify them up close, its important to continue to evaluate your process and zoom out to see what you may be excluding
Still, historians working with larger data sets based on OCR or similar can be tempted by a simple keyword search in a fulltext collection
  Dr. Beal mentions this in her seminar
  This doesn't allow for the stories to grow from the patterns and evidence, rather it only comes from the historian's prior knowledge/bias
In other classes it is certainly easiest to do some simple keyword searches and go from there, parsing what the search engine spits out
  Finding and manipulating larger data sets on the end user side can yeild a more complete picture
There is still the problem of access, as there is minimal incentive for powerful corporations to digitise and make their work available
  As noted in the update to Dr. Beal's seminar, collaboration and public discussion are key
  You never know who may be listening
  
  I really struggled with the tools/time management this week
